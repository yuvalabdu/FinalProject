# Final Project - Yuval Abdu

### **_This project created to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in Automation Testing._**
***
The project supports: Web, Mobile, Desktop, Electron apps, API and Data Base.

**Big advantage of the infrastructure is that it can be easy maintained!**

## Description

This project demonstates a smart automation infrastructure. It is bulid in 2 main sections: Main- contains all the infrastructure, and Test: contains all the tests. in the main section there are 4 packages (extensions, pageObjects, utilities, workflows) that contain number of classes with methods.

* Data Driven Testing.
* Support Of Different Clients/Browsers.
* Failure Mechanism.
* External Files Support.
* Visual Testing.
* Reporting System (including screenshots).

### List of applications were used in this project:

* Web: [sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
* Mobile: Mortgage Calculator App.
* API: Students-List server.
* Electron: To Do List.
* Desktop: Windows Calculator.
* Data Base: [sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

## Tools & Frameworks used in the project:

* Java.
* TestNG Framework.
* Web: Selenium WebDriver.
* Mobile: Appium.
* Electron: Selenium ElectronDriver.
* Desktop: WinAppDriver.
* Visual Testing: Sikuli.
* API: Rest Assured.
* [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/).
* Allure reports- as the main reporting system.
* [Monte Screen Recorder](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.stephenc.monte/monte-screen-recorder) - for video screen record.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Free Online DB- used for login to SauceDemo web page.
